**Estate Real** is a platfrom to manage all the properties,transactions,agents and their managed properties.
All can be done from one place.

    - The billing will be done monthly based on the customerâ€™s preference.
- **Convenient Modification:**
    - Customers can update their rent duration and cancel anytime before starting of new month.
    - The distributor will be notified about the change such that they get sufficient time to fulfill the requirements.
- **Agent Role:**
    - Agent will be assigned to the buyer and agent will help in completing the transaction.
